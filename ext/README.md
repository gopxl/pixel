# Extensions

## Introduction

Extensions are a way to *extend* the features and functionality of Pixel. They are the communities contribution
to pushing Pixel to the next level.


## Extension List

* [atlas](./atlas/README.md) - Texture atlasing for more efficient rendering.
* [gameloop](./gameloop/README.md) - An extension that allows you to run a game loop in Pixel.
* [imdraw](./imdraw/README.md) - An extension that allows you to draw primitives in Pixel.
* [text](./text/README.md) - An extension that allows you to draw text in Pixel.


## Creating an Extension

Extensions are just a collection of files that are placed in the `ext` directory. The directory name
is the name of the extension. The extension directory must contain a `README.md` file that describes the extension.
Make sure to provide some example code in the **README** so that users are aware of how to use the extension.

You are encouraged to create an example of your extension in the [pixel-examples](https://github.com/gopxl/pixel-examples). This will allow users
to see your extension in action and how to use it.
