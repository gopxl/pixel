In this part, we're going to take a look at creating a window with Pixel. This part assumes that you've successfully installed [Go](https://golang.org/), set up your $GOPATH and installed Pixel. If so, let's dive in!

## Import

First things first, we need to import [Pixel](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel).

```go
package main

import "github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2"
```

If you scroll through the types and functions of the Pixel package, you'll see that windows, OpenGL, or anything related, isn't mentioned there at all. That's because Pixel itself is a platform and back-end independent library. To create a window and utilize OpenGL to draw our graphics, we also need to import Pixel's [OpenGL](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/backends/opengl) library. The rest of the documents in this wiki will refer to this as "PixelGL".

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2"
	"github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/backends/opengl"
)
```

PixelGL package provides all of the functionality necessary to create a window and draw using OpenGL. But don't worry, we won't have to write a single line of OpenGL.

## Run

_If you don't care about the technical explanation, you can skip this text in italic and go straight to the code._

_There's one ugly thing about graphics and operating systems. That one thing is that most operating systems require all graphics and windowing code to be executed from the main thread of our program. This is really cumbersome with Go. Go is a highly concurrent language with goroutines. Goroutines can freely jump from thread to thread, which makes the previous requirement seemingly impossible. Not all is lost, however. Go's runtime provides a convenient function [runtime.LockOSThread](https://godoc.org/runtime#LockOSThread), which locks current goroutine on it's current thread. PixelGL uses this functionality and provides you with a simpler interface to it._

_You don't have to deal with the main thread stuff at all with Pixel. You can run your game concurrently, however you want. You only need to allow Pixel to use the main thread._

In order to allow PixelGL to use the main thread for all the windowing and graphics code, we need to make this call from our `main` function:

```go
func main() {
	opengl.Run(run)
}
```

What's `run`? Calling [opengl.Run](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/backends/opengl#Run) puts PixelGL in control of the `main` function. There's no way for us to run any code in the `main` function anymore. That's why we need to pass another function, `run` in this case to `opengl.Run`. PixelGL will run our `run` function. We use our `run` function as, basically, a new main.

```go
func run() {
	// all of our code will be fired up from here
}

func main() {
	opengl.Run(run)
}
```

## Window

Now that've got everything set up, we can proceed to create a window. There are many possible parameters for a window, it's size, title, whether it should be focused, maximized, fullscreen, etc. Typing all of these parameters as function arguments would be cumbersome and unreadable. That's why we have a [opengl.WindowConfig](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/backends/opengl#WindowConfig) struct, that let's us set up all of the parameters in a convenient fashion.

```go
func run() {
	cfg := opengl.WindowConfig{
		Title:  "Pixel Rocks!",
		Bounds: pixel.R(0, 0, 1024, 768),
	}
}
```

Let's break this down. We create a `opengl.WindowConfig` struct value and assign it to the `cfg` variable for later use. We only need to change two fields in the `opengl.WindowConfig` struct, the rest uses sensible defaults. The first field we set is the window title. The second field is the bounds of the window. This is a little unusual, if you've used other game libraries. Other game libraries usually only let you set the size of the window. PixelGL allows us to set a rectangle. All things drawn within this rectangle will be visible inside the window. Note, that this has nothing to do with the window's position on the screen.

The function [pixel.R](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel#R) creates a new rectangle. First two arguments are the coordinates of the lower-left corner of the rectangle. Last two arguments are the coordinates of the upper-right corner of the rectangle. This way, we create a window of size 1024x768 pixels.

Now, we use the `cfg` variable to create an actual window.

```go
func run() {
	cfg := opengl.WindowConfig{
		Title:  "Pixel Rocks!",
		Bounds: pixel.R(0, 0, 1024, 768),
	}
	win, err := opengl.NewWindow(cfg)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

The function [opengl.NewWindow](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/backends/opengl#NewWindow) takes a `opengl.WindowConfig` and creates a new window with the supplied parameters. It also returns a potential error. An error can occur when, for example, no graphics device is available.

Next, we need to create a main loop, to keep the window up and running until a user clicks the close button.

```go
func run() {
	cfg := opengl.WindowConfig{
		Title:  "Pixel Rocks!",
		Bounds: pixel.R(0, 0, 1024, 768),
	}
	win, err := opengl.NewWindow(cfg)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	for !win.Closed() {
		win.Update()
	}
}
```

When our `run` function finishes, the whole program exists, so we need to make sure, that `run` is running until we want to actually exit our program.

Here we run a loop that finishes when a user closes our window. We need to call [win.Update](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/backends/opengl#Window.Update) periodically. The function `win.Update` fetches new events (key presses, mouse moves and clicks, etc.) and redraws the window.

Now it's time to run the program. What you'll see is a black 1024x768 window. When we click on the close button, the window closes and the program exists. Congratulations, that's your first, fully working window with Pixel!

## VSync

You'll notice, that the window does not move very smoothly and also, our program consumes a lot of CPU. That's because we're calling the `win.Update` method as fast as we can, we're pretty much calling it all the time. That's not necessary at all, most games refresh the screen (call `win.Update`) 60 times per second and some even do it only 30 times per second. The most reasonable thing is to update the window at the same rate as is the refresh rate of your monitor, which is usually 60hz (60 times per second). To enable this, we have to set the `VSync` field in the `cfg`.

```go
cfg := opengl.WindowConfig{
	Title:  "Pixel Rocks!",
	Bounds: pixel.R(0, 0, 1024, 768),
	VSync:  true,
}
```

Now our window updates only as often as the monitor refreshes, which is enough.

## Background color

We'll do one more improvement. Black window is boring. How about a firebrick one? Or skyblue? There's a package `"golang.org/x/image/colornames"`, which provides all of these colors and many more. Just go get it!

```
$ go get golang.org/x/image/colornames
```

Now, we need to import it.

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2"
	"github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/backends/opengl"
	"golang.org/x/image/colornames"
)
```

And finally, use it!

```go
win.Clear(colornames.Skyblue)

for !win.Closed() {
	win.Update()
}
```

![creating a window skyblue](./images/01_creating_a_window_skyblue.png)

Here's the whole code of this program.

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2"
	"github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/backends/opengl"
	"golang.org/x/image/colornames"
)

func run() {
	cfg := opengl.WindowConfig{
		Title:  "Pixel Rocks!",
		Bounds: pixel.R(0, 0, 1024, 768),
		VSync:  true,
	}
	win, err := opengl.NewWindow(cfg)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer win.Destroy()

	win.Clear(colornames.Skyblue)

	for !win.Closed() {
		win.Update()
	}
}

func main() {
	opengl.Run(run)
}
```

Some of you might wonder, why we call `win.Clear` outside of the main loop. Well, in Pixel, you don't need to clear the window on each frame. Calling `win.Update` redraws the window every time (but doesn't erase it's content).
