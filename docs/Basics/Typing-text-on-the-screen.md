[Previous Tutorial](./Drawing-shapes-with-IMDraw.md)

In this part, we're going to learn how to draw text using various fonts and how to get text input from the user.

## font.Face

In order to draw any text, a font is required. You might have already noticed, that Pixel tries to be very compatible with standard Go packages, such as `"image"`, `"image/color"`, `"time"`, and so on. Unfortunately, there's no font package in the Go standard library.

However, there's a semi-standard package called [`"golang.org/x/image/font"`](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/image/font). I must say, this package deserves to be considered standard, it's remarkably well designed and easy to use. It defines one important interface: [font.Face](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/image/font#Face). Anything implementing this interface is a font object. There are many implementations of this interface found, for example, in [`"golang.org/x/image/font/basicfont"`](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/image/font/basicfont), [`"golang.org/x/image/font/inconsolata"`](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/image/font/inconsolata) and [`"github.com/golang/freetype/truetype"`](https://godoc.org/github.com/golang/freetype/truetype).

As you can see, Go community has already done a great deal of work regarding fonts. Pixel makes use of this work, thus supporting large variety of fonts out of the box. Let's see how we do it!

## Atlas

Pixel has a [text](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/ext/text) package, which we can use to draw text to any [Target](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2#Target). Let's take a look and use it! As usual, we'll start off with the basic Pixel boilerplate:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2"
	"github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/backends/opengl"
)

func run() {
	cfg := opengl.WindowConfig{
		Title:  "Pixel Rocks!",
		Bounds: pixel.R(0, 0, 1024, 768),
		VSync:  true,
	}
	win, err := opengl.NewWindow(cfg)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	for !win.Closed() {
		win.Update()
	}
}

func main() {
	opengl.Run(run)
}
```

Now, we need to import the `"github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/ext/text"` package:

```go
import (
	"github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2"
	"github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/backends/opengl"
	"github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/ext/text"
)
```

Before we can draw any text, we need to create a font atlas. What is that? To achieve the maximum performance, it's best to pre-draw the characters we want to use to an off-screen picture and then draw the characters straight from that picture. Drawing directly from the `font.Face` object would be too slow. This is exactly what [Atlas](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/ext/text#Atlas) is. It's a collection of pre-drawn characters, ready to use for drawing.

An `Atlas` is created by the [text.NewAtlas](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/ext/text#NewAtlas) constructor. The constructor takes a `font.Face`, that's obvious. Then is takes an arbitrary number of, so called, "rune sets". A rune set is just a slice of runes. The `Atlas` will contain all of the runes provided in all of the sets. This might be a bit confusing, so let's see an example:

```go
atlas := text.NewAtlas(
	basicfont.Face7x13,
	[]rune{'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'},
)
```

Here we create an `Atlas` from the [basicfont.Face7x13](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/image/font/basicfont#pkg-variables) font face, which contains all digits. So, with this atlas, we're able to draw digits. Simple? Let's take a look at another example:

```go
atlas := text.NewAtlas(
	basicfont.Face7x13,
	[]rune{'a', 'b', 'c'},
	[]rune{'A', 'B', 'C'},
)
```

Here we supply two rune sets instead of one. The atlas will contain both lower-case `a`, `b`, `c` letters, as well as upper-case ones. Here's another example:

```go
atlas := text.NewAtlas(basicfont.Face7x13, text.ASCII)
```

This time, we use [text.ASCII](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/ext/text#pkg-variables), which is the set of all ASCII runes defined in the `text` package. One more example:

```go
atlas := text.NewAtlas(face, text.ASCII, text.RangeTable(unicode.Latin))
```

This time, we don't use the `basicfont.Face7x13` face, instead we use a font contained in some `face` variable, which could be an arbitrary truetype font for example (we'll see how to load truetype fonts in a minute). Now, our atlas contains not only ASCII characters, but also all Latin characters. Function [text.RangeTable](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/ext/text#RangeTable) converts an arbitrary [unicode.RangeTable](https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/#RangeTable) to a set of runes. The standard [unicode](https://golang.org/pkg/unicode/) package contains a large variety of useful Unicode range tables.

Now that we understand all of this, let's go ahead and create an atlas!

```go
	cfg := opengl.WindowConfig{
		Title:  "Pixel Rocks!",
		Bounds: pixel.R(0, 0, 1024, 768),
		VSync:  true,
	}
	win, err := opengl.NewWindow(cfg)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	basicAtlas := text.NewAtlas(basicfont.Face7x13, text.ASCII)
```

For now, we'll use the font defined in the [basicfont](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/image/font/basicfont) package, because it's the most accessible one, as we can see.

## Text

Now, how do we actually draw a text? For that we have the [Text](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/ext/text#Text) type. You can think of the `Text` type as a sprite containing text. Contrary to a sprite, we can dynamically write new text to a `Text` object as we'll see. So, without further ado, let's create a `Text object using the [text.New](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/ext/text#New) constructor.

```go
	basicAtlas := text.NewAtlas(basicfont.Face7x13, text.ASCII)
	basicTxt := text.New(pixel.V(100, 500), basicAtlas)
```

The `text.New` constructor takes two arguments: the `orig` position and an atlas. The atlas is obvious. What is the "orig" position? It's the position where we want to start drawing our text. We chose `pixel.V(100, 500)`, so the text will start at that position. Let's write some text:

```go
	basicAtlas := text.NewAtlas(basicfont.Face7x13, text.ASCII)
	basicTxt := text.New(pixel.V(100, 500), basicAtlas)

	fmt.Fprintln(basicTxt, "Hello, text!")
	fmt.Fprintln(basicTxt, "I support multiple lines!")
	fmt.Fprintf(basicTxt, "And I'm an %s, yay!", "io.Writer")
```

And draw the result to the screen:

```go
	for !win.Closed() {
		win.Clear(colornames.Black)
		basicTxt.Draw(win, pixel.IM)
		win.Update()
	}
```

And heya, here we go!

![typing text on the screen first](./images/07_typing_text_on_the_screen_first.png)

That text is a bit small, let's scale it up!

```go
	for !win.Closed() {
		win.Clear(colornames.Black)
		basicTxt.Draw(win, pixel.IM.Scaled(basicTxt.Orig, 4))
		win.Update()
	}
```

![typing text on the screen scaled](./images/07_typing_text_on_the_screen_scaled.png)

Much better!

## Orig and Dot

We've got something running, we see text on the screen, but we don't fully understand how it works. In the constructor, we were setting a mysterious `orig` argument:

```go
	basicTxt := text.New(pixel.V(100, 500), basicAtlas)
```

If we a look at the documentation of the [Text](TODO) struct, we see that it actually has an `Orig` field. If we check the value of this field, we find that it's equal to the value we passed in the constructor.

Before we fully explain what this field does, we need to take a look at another important field: `Dot`. `Dot` is simple: it's the position of the next character. When we write some string to the `Text` object, `Dot` is be automatically moved accordingly. Initially, `Dot` is set to the same value as `Orig`. As we write text, `Dot` moves. We can also adjust it manually, if we so desire.

To understand `Dot` better, try writing small chunks of text to the `Text` object and print the value of `Dot` after each chunk.

What happens when we write a newline? Easy, `Dot` moves one line down and aligns with `Orig`. This is the most important use of `Orig`. Notice, that only `Orig`'s X coordinate is used to align after newline. In fact, `Text` never really uses it's Y coordinate.

Try changing the value of `Orig` after each newline.

Another important use of `Orig` is this:

```go
txt.Clear()
```

Aside from erasing the content of the Text object, `Clear` resets the `Dot` to `Orig` (you start writing from the beginning). In case you don't want to reset the `Dot`, but still want to erase the Text, here's how you do it:

```go
dot := txt.Dot
txt.Clear()
txt.Dot = dot
```

## Properties

Aside from `Orig` and `Dot`, there are several other things we can adjust when writing text. Let's take a look at those!

The first one is `Color`. It's a simple field, we can assign it and whatever we write after will have that color. Let's see! Replace this:

```go
	fmt.Fprintln(basicTxt, "Hello, text!")
	fmt.Fprintln(basicTxt, "I support multiple lines!")
	fmt.Fprintf(basicTxt, "And I'm an %s, yay!", "io.Writer")
```

With this:

```go
	basicTxt.Color = colornames.Red
	fmt.Fprintln(basicTxt, "Hello, text!")

	basicTxt.Color = colornames.Green
	fmt.Fprintln(basicTxt, "I support multiple lines!")

	basicTxt.Color = colornames.Blue
	fmt.Fprintf(basicTxt, "And I'm an %s, yay!", "io.Writer")
```

And here we go!

![typing text on the screen color](./images/07_typing_text_on_the_screen_color.png)

Another property that we can set it `LineHeight`. This property is simply the number of pixels `Dot` travels downwards when it encounters a newline. We could set it to a fixed number of pixels, or we could set it to a multiple of the standard line height of the atlas, like this:

```go
	basicAtlas := text.NewAtlas(basicfont.Face7x13, text.ASCII)
	basicTxt := text.New(pixel.V(100, 500), basicAtlas)

	basicTxt.LineHeight = basicAtlas.LineHeight() * 1.5

	basicTxt.Color = colornames.Red
	fmt.Fprintln(basicTxt, "Hello, text!")
```

And take a look, wider line spacing!

![typing text on the screen lin height](./images/07_typing_text_on_the_screen_line_height.png)

The last property is `TabWidth`, you can tell what it does. Experiment with it yourself!

## Truetype

Now that we know how `Text` works, we obviously need better fonts to get better results! I've got a beautiful font up in my sleeves that I downloaded from [fontlibrary.org](https://fontlibrary.org/), download it here:

[Intuitive Truetype Font](intuitive.ttf)

Now, the main question is, how do we load such a font? We know that the `text.NewAtlas` constructor wants `font.Face`, so we need to create one. If we take a look at the documentation of the [`"github.com/golang/freetype/truetype"`](https://godoc.org/github.com/golang/freetype/truetype) package, we see this function:

```go
func NewFace(f *Font, opts *Options) font.Face
```

Good, that's where we get the `font.Face` from. But, this function wants a `truetype.Font`, how do we get that? The answer is the [truetype.Parse](https://godoc.org/github.com/golang/freetype/truetype#Parse), which just takes a slice of bytes (the file) and returns a `truetype.Font`. Great, with this knowledge, let's create ourselves a TTF font loading function:

```go
func loadTTF(path string, size float64) (font.Face, error) {
	file, err := os.Open(path)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	defer file.Close()

	bytes, err := ioutil.ReadAll(file)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	font, err := truetype.Parse(bytes)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return truetype.NewFace(font, &truetype.Options{
		Size:              size,
		GlyphCacheEntries: 1,
	}), nil
}
```

Let's break it down! First, we simply open the TTF file. Next, we read all of the bytes from it to a single slice of bytes. Then, we use the `truetype.Parse` function to parse the byte slice and create a `truetype.Font` object. Finally, we convert this `truetype.Font` object to a `font.Face` object, which is what we need.

One thing, that deserves attention is the `truetype.Options` struct. Here we say the size of the font we want to use. The `GlyphCacheEntries` field says, how many characters (glyphs) should the `font.Face` object remember in it's cache to speed up the text drawing. Since we don't use the `font.Face` object directly when drawing text (we create an `Atlas` instead), we don't really need this cache. So, we just set it to 1. This avoids a lot of memory consumption. I advice you always set this value to 1 when using Pixel.

So, let's replace our `basicfont.Face7x13` with the beautiful Truetype font! First, we need to load it.

```go
	win, err := opengl.NewWindow(cfg)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	face, err := loadTTF("intuitive.ttf", 52)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
```

Now, we rename `basicAtlas` and `basicTxt` to `atlas` and `txt`, since they're not basic anymore. Then, we pass the new font to the `atlas`.

```go
	atlas := text.NewAtlas(face, text.ASCII)
	txt := text.New(pixel.V(100, 500), atlas)
```

Finally, we get rid of the scaling, this text needs to be crisp! Replace this:

```go
	for !win.Closed() {
		win.Clear(colornames.Black)
		txt.Draw(win, pixel.IM.Scaled(txt.Orig, 4))
		win.Update()
	}
```

with this:

```go
	for !win.Closed() {
		win.Clear(colornames.Black)
		txt.Draw(win, pixel.IM)
		win.Update()
	}
```

Just look at it! Isn't it beautiful?

![typing text on the screen truetype](./images/07_typing_text_on_the_screen_truetype.png)

We can do an even bigger font, just to fully admire it!

```go
	face, err := loadTTF("intuitive.ttf", 80)
```

And change the background color.

```go
		win.Clear(colornames.White)
```

In case you notice little artifacts on the letters, just set the smooth drawing.

```go
	win, err := opengl.NewWindow(cfg)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	win.SetSmooth(true)
```

Now, this is it!

![typing text on the screen big](./images/07_typing_text_on_the_screen_big.png)

## Aligning

Writing newlines allows for easy alignment to the left. But how about other alignments? To the right? To the center? `Text` has no property for that, but we can use the ability to get the bounding rectangle of any string to implement arbitrary alignment. Let's take a look at that!

First, let's get rid of all our previous text writing code.

```go
	// delete all of this

	txt.LineHeight = atlas.LineHeight() * 1.5

	txt.Color = colornames.Red
	fmt.Fprintln(txt, "Hello, text!")

	txt.Color = colornames.Green
	fmt.Fprintln(txt, "I support multiple lines!")

	txt.Color = colornames.Blue
	fmt.Fprintf(txt, "And I'm an %s, yay!", "io.Writer")
```

Aligning to the right will not be as simple as writing newlines, we will need to write each line separately and take some extra steps. That's why we first create a slice of lines we will write.

```go
	atlas := text.NewAtlas(face, text.ASCII)
	txt := text.New(pixel.V(100, 500), atlas)

	lines := []string{
		"This is a very very very long line",
		"Short line",
		"--=!@#$^&*()_+=--",
	}
```

Now, we'll range over this slice and write each line properly.

```go
	lines := []string{
		"This is a very long line",
		"Short line",
		"!@#$^&*()_+",
	}

	txt.Color = colornames.Black

	for _, line := range lines {
		txt.Dot.X -= txt.BoundsOf(line).W()
		fmt.Fprintln(txt, line)
	}
```

Now, let's study this closely. First, we set the text color. If forgot to do that, the text would be white and since the background is white too, we'd end up very confused. Then we range over the slice of lines. We `fmt.Fprintln` each line, but before that, we move the `Dot` to the left by the width of the line's bounding rectangle.

To obtain this bounding rectangle, we used [txt.BoundsOf](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/ext/text#Text.BoundsOf) method. The `txt.BoundsOf` method is easy, takes a string and returns the bounding rectangle of that string if it was to be written to the `txt` right now.

Remember, `Text` aligns `Dot` to `Orig` after each newline. Thus, at the beginning of the `for` loop's body, `Dot` is aligned with `Orig`. When we move the `Dot` just the right distance to the left, the text we write after will end up just aligned to the `Orig` by it's right edge.

Also, we need to move the `Orig` somewhere to the right, otherwise most of the text will end up outside the window.

```go
	atlas := text.NewAtlas(face, text.ASCII)
	txt := text.New(pixel.V(900, 500), atlas)
```

Finally, let's change the text of the color and the background, it's getting old.

```go
	txt.Color = colornames.Lightgrey
```

and

```go
		win.Clear(colornames.Darkcyan)
```

Now, let's run this!

![typing text on the screen align right](./images/07_typing_text_on_the_screen_align_right.png)

Great! How about aligning to the center? Well, instead of moving the `Dot` back by the whole line width, we need to move it by the half of it instead.

```go
	for _, line := range lines {
		txt.Dot.X -= txt.BoundsOf(line).W() / 2
		fmt.Fprintln(txt, line)
	}
```

And we need to move the `Orig` again.

```go
	atlas := text.NewAtlas(face, text.ASCII)
	txt := text.New(pixel.V(500, 500), atlas)
```

Works great!

![typing text on the screen align center](./images/07_typing_text_on_the_screen_align_center.png)

## Typed

Ok, now we know all about putting the text on the screen. But how about getting it from the user? Of course, we could go and check each possible key, using the `win.Pressed` or `win.JustPressed` methods. We'd also need to handle SHIFT, and all of the other keys and it'd still be wrong, because we wouldn't support localized keyboards. As you might have guessed, Pixel has a special solution for this problem.

The solution is called [win.Typed](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/backends/opengl#Window.Typed) and it's a simple method which takes no arguments and returns a string. The returned string is what the user typed on the keyboard since the last call to `win.Update` (actually, what the user typed between the previous call to `win.Update` and the one before that, but simpler thinking doesn't hurt).

Because of the limitations of [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/), which PixelGL uses, the returned string does not contain newlines or tabs. This limitation might get overcome someday in Pixel, but so far, we'll have to handle newlines and tabs manually, which is not too hard.

So, let's type text on the screen! First, let's get rid of those centered lines.

```go
	// delete this
	lines := []string{
		"This is a very long line",
		"Short line",
		"!@#$^&*()_+",
	}
```

```go
	// and delete this
	for _, line := range lines {
		txt.Dot.X -= txt.BoundsOf(line).W() / 2
		fmt.Fprintln(txt, line)
	}
```

And now, let's just type into the `txt`!

```go
	for !win.Closed() {
		txt.WriteString(win.Typed())

		win.Clear(colornames.Darkcyan)
		txt.Draw(win, pixel.IM)
		win.Update()
	}
```

This time, we use the [txt.WriteString](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/ext/text#Text.WriteString) method instead of the `"fmt"` package, but the `"fmt"` package would serve just as good (although `"fmt"` would be a little slower).

As we've said, this does not support newlines, so let's add support for them.

```go
	for !win.Closed() {
		txt.WriteString(win.Typed())
		if win.JustPressed(pixel.KeyEnter) {
			txt.WriteRune('\n')
		}
```

Finally, let's put our text to the center of the screen. Note, that the text will still be left-aligned, but it's bounding box will be centered on the screen. To do that, we'll use the [txt.Bounds](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2/ext/text#Text.Bounds), which returns the bounding rectangle of the text that's already written to the `Text` object.

```go
		win.Clear(colornames.Darkcyan)
		txt.Draw(win, pixel.IM.Moved(win.Bounds().Center().Sub(txt.Bounds().Center())))
		win.Update()
```

![typing text on the screen typed](./images/07_typing_text_on_the_screen_typed.png)

Works like charm! You might notice though, that the typing is a bit lagging. That's because of VSync. VSync always makes input a little behind, that's the compromise you're making when using it. However, we don't like it here, so let's turn VSync off and manage the framerate at 120 FPS manually. This will allow for a very smooth typing experience.

```go
	cfg := opengl.WindowConfig{
		Title:  "Pixel Rocks!",
		Bounds: pixel.R(0, 0, 1024, 768),
		VSync:  true, // delete
	}
```

To manually manage the FPS, we'll create a ticker using the standard `"time"` library and simply synchronize with it's ticking.

```go
	fps := time.Tick(time.Second / 120)

	for !win.Closed() {
		txt.WriteString(win.Typed())
		if win.JustPressed(pixel.KeyEnter) {
			txt.WriteRune('\n')
		}

		win.Clear(colornames.Darkcyan)
		txt.Draw(win, pixel.IM.Moved(win.Bounds().Center().Sub(txt.Bounds().Center())))
		win.Update()

		<-fps
	}
```

Much smoother now!

One more thing. When you hold down a regular key, such as an 'A', after a bit of time it starts repeating. However, this does not happen with the ENTER key. To fix it, we need to check whether the ENTER key got repeated, aside from being just pressed.

```go
		txt.WriteString(win.Typed())
		if win.JustPressed(pixel.KeyEnter) || win.Repeated(pixel.KeyEnter) {
			txt.WriteRune('\n')
		}
```

This was a long tutorial. We're at the end! Hooray! Here's the final code.
