# Pixel Wiki

Pixel is a mature, fast, innovative 2D game library in Go.

This Wiki contains a set of tutorials, each covering a different aspect of Pixel.

Apart from just describing the features and concepts in Pixel, each tutorial tries to bring something more. They teach about some of the most useful game development patterns and techniques as well as giving some useful tricks.

If you are a seasoned game developer, just skim through the tutorials to grasp the main concepts of Pixel. Then focus on the [API documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopxl/pixel/v2).
